description: Use when you notice a repeated pattern worth automating, want to change your own behavior (block/rewrite tool calls, inject context), need to accumulate domain knowledge for future sessions, or a built-in tool doesn't fit the project — this is your self-modification interface. Also use proactively: after doing the same manual sequence 3+ times, evolve it into a tool.

# Evolve — Self-Modification Interface

You can rewrite your own capabilities by writing files to `.mimocode/`. Tools, hooks, and skills hot-reload on the next turn — no restart. This skill is not just documentation: it is a standing instruction to **notice when you should evolve, and act on it**.

## When to evolve (triggers)

Act on these signals — don't wait for the user to ask:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| You ran the same bash/API sequence 3+ times (this or past sessions) | Wrap it into a **tool** |
| You keep making the same mistake, or the user keeps correcting the same behavior | Add a **hook** to block/fix it structurally |
| You learned non-obvious project knowledge that future sessions will need | Write a **skill** to persist it |
| A built-in tool's behavior conflicts with project needs | **Override** it (same-name tool) |
| A workflow you hand-orchestrated worked well and may repeat | Save it as a **workflow** script |

Before creating: check whether the extension already exists (`ls .mimocode/tools .mimocode/hooks .mimocode/skills`). Prefer improving an existing one over adding a near-duplicate.

## Decision flow

```
Need to change WHAT you can do  → tool   (new capability, wraps commands/APIs)
Need to change HOW you behave   → hook   (intercept/modify/block existing behavior)
Need to remember HOW to do X    → skill  (knowledge, loaded on demand)
Need to redo a multi-agent run  → workflow (.mimocode/workflows/*.js)
Need to change the UI           → TUI plugin (.mimocode/tui/*.tsx)
```

Rule of thumb: tools add verbs, hooks add reflexes, skills add memories.

## Creating Tools

Write to `.mimocode/tools/<name>.ts`:

```ts
import { tool } from "@mimo-ai/plugin"

export default tool({
  description: "What this tool does",
  args: {
    param1: tool.schema.string().describe("Parameter description"),
  },
  async execute(args, ctx) {
    // ctx.directory — project root
    // ctx.worktree — git worktree root
    // ctx.abort — AbortSignal
    return `Result: ${args.param1}`
  },
})
```

Multiple tools per file: use named exports instead of default.
A tool with the same id as a built-in (bash, read, edit, ...) **replaces** it.

## Creating Hooks

Write to `.mimocode/hooks/<name>.ts` — export a Hooks object:

```ts
export default {
  "tool.execute.before": async (input, output) => {
    if (input.tool === "bash" && output.args.command?.includes("rm -rf /")) {
      output.cancel = true
      output.cancelReason = "Blocked dangerous command"
    }
  },
  "experimental.chat.system.transform": async (input, output) => {
    output.system.push("Additional instruction here.")
  },
}
```

### Hook Events

| Event | Capability |
|-------|-----------|
| `tool.execute.before` | Modify args or `cancel=true` to block |
| `tool.execute.after` | Modify tool output |
| `tool.definition` | Modify tool description/parameters |
| `chat.params` | Modify temperature, topP, maxOutputTokens |
| `experimental.chat.system.transform` | Append to system prompt |
| `experimental.chat.messages.transform` | Modify message list sent to LLM |
| `permission.ask` | Auto-allow/deny permission requests |
| `shell.env` | Inject environment variables |

## Creating Skills

Write to `.mimocode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when [triggering conditions — not a workflow summary]
---
Instructions here...
```

## File Locations

| Type | Path | Hot-reload |
|------|------|-----------|
| Tools | `.mimocode/tools/*.ts` | next turn |
| Hooks | `.mimocode/hooks/*.ts` | next turn |
| Skills | `.mimocode/skills/*/SKILL.md` | next turn |
| Workflows | `.mimocode/workflows/*.js` | on invoke |
| TUI | `.mimocode/tui/*.tsx` | restart |

## Evolution loop (do this every time)

1. **Create** the extension (smallest thing that works).
2. **Verify immediately** — invoke the tool / trigger the hook on the next turn. A broken extension is worse than none.
3. **Tell the user** what you created and why, in one sentence.
4. **Iterate or delete** — if it misfires later, fix it or remove it. Don't leave dead extensions; they pollute your own tool list.

## Detailed API Reference

For full type signatures, all available fields, and more examples:

- See @reference/tool-api.md for Tool schema and ToolContext
- See @reference/hook-api.md for all hook events with input/output types
- See @reference/skill-api.md for SKILL.md format and frontmatter fields
- See @reference/tui-api.md for TUI plugin slots, commands, dialogs, and state

## Constraints

- Tools/hooks have same permissions as bash — no privilege escalation
- Cannot modify the permission system
- Tool output truncated at 50KB / 2000 lines
- Prefer small, composable extensions over monolithic ones
- Never create an extension that hides information from the user or bypasses confirmation prompts
